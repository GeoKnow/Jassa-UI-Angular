# Jassa-UI-Angular

## Overview
This repository provides Angular components for working with data in SPARQL endpoints built on top of the [JAvaScript Suite for Sparql Access (Jassa)](https://github.com/GeoKnow/Jassa-Core).

The project is comprised of three submodules:

* [jassa-ui-angular-core](jassa-ui-angular-core): Provides widgets for faceted search
* [jassa-ui-angular-edit](jassa-ui-angular-edit): A toolkit for making RDF editing with HTML forms easy by introducing a set of attributes.
* [jassa-ui-angular-openlayers](jassa-ui-angular-openlayers): A widget for connecting an Openlayers map on the fly with a SPARQL endpoint. Works with large date through use of a quad tree space partitioning approach when querying for data.
