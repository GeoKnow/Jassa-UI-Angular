### Two-way databinding of form controls to an RDF graph


### Emitting triples
<div rex-subject="ex:JohnDoe" rex-instance-of="ex:Person"></div>

The obvious conflict is: if a triple is forced, it is constant and thus cannot directly participate in two-way databinding.
Yet, it would be possible to apply usual overriding (i.e. updates) to it afterwards.
